# GEN-508 piece 1 — build artifacts (scoping layer rebuilt 2026-08-03)

Working copies for the Notion half of the ticket-quality gate. **Nothing here is installed** — the
live `~/.claude/hooks/auto-approve.js` is untouched, and installing it goes through `/vet-code`.

The authoritative handoff is the **"BUILD STATE"** section of
[GEN-508](https://app.notion.com/p/3a36e495d07c81fb9a55ddc315639c7f). Read that first; this folder is
the artifacts it refers to.

| File | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `design-scoping-v3.md` | **Retired as a normative source** (2026-08-03, v6): it was merged into `design-converged.md`, because the two-document split was itself the defect three `/check` lenses diagnosed. Kept only for its §1 corpus-shape table and §3 measurements, which are cited from the design. **Do not build from it.** |
| `auto-approve.working.js` | Full working copy of the hook with the rebuilt `enforceTicketVetting` arm. Purely additive against the live hook: 5 hunks, 915 lines added, **0 removed**. Passes `node --check`. |
| `gen508-hook.diff` | The same change as a unified diff against the live hook, for review. |
| `test-gen508.js` | The behavioural suite for the layer — run it (see below). 97 assertions. |
| `build-corpus.js` | Regenerates the payload corpus `test-gen508.js` part B needs. |
| `vet-ticket-SKILL.md` | Working copy of the new `/vet-ticket` skill (not yet installed at `~/.claude/skills/vet-ticket/`). |
| `design-converged.md` | **Read this second, after the ticket — it is the single normative document for piece 1.** Currently **v8** (2026-08-04): §4.5's raw-REST mechanism was replaced after five rounds found the same class of hole five times, and the replacement went through three more `/check` rounds. Its own top box carries the review state. `v8-measurement-scripts.txt` beside it is the provenance for §4.5's numbers. |

## Running the tests

```bash
node test-gen508.js
```

That covers parts A (edge cases), C (pass round-trip) and D (the shared hash CLI) — 95 assertions.

**Part B is the fail-open detector and it needs the corpus, which is deliberately not committed**
(it contains ticket bodies). Regenerate it first — it reads `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`, takes a
couple of minutes, and writes `notion-payload-corpus.jsonl` beside itself:

```bash
node build-corpus.js
```

Then re-run `node test-gen508.js` and part B sweeps all 1,313 real payloads twice. What it asserts:
with the resolver stubbed to say *everything is a ticket*, no payload may come back out-of-scope
unless it is a housekeeping edit, a GEN-58-subtree content write, or a create with no page target.
Anything else in that bucket is a silent bypass — which is exactly how the two previous versions of
this layer failed, both times found only after the fact.

Last run: **97 passed, 0 failed**; 0 unexplained out-of-scope verdicts across 1,313 payloads.

## What changed in the rebuild

The old layer read specific field paths from the published tool schema. Real traffic does not always
put the fields there, so two consecutive code-review rounds each found a fresh silent bypass of the
same class. The rebuild makes payload shape stop mattering: normalise the whole payload, look for a
Team-Tasks id anywhere in it, then resolve whatever page ids remain — with `ok = false` from the
normaliser as a hard block, so no later stage can claim "out of scope" without having read
everything.

Two build-time decisions worth a reviewer's attention, because neither is spelled out in the design:

- **The content hash is now reachable as a CLI** — `node auto-approve.js --ticket-hash <payload.json>`
  — and `/vet-ticket` calls it instead of reproducing the formula. The design required the skill to
  use the same normaliser as the hook; that normaliser is ~100 lines, and a hand-rolled copy would
  drift, which is a failure whose only escape is break-glass. That invocation is added to the
  shell auto-approve list (it only reads a file and prints a hash), pinned to the hook's own
  `__filename` so a planted `auto-approve.js` elsewhere cannot ride the allow entry.
- **Cache seeding on create/duplicate is impossible, not merely unimplemented.** `design-converged.md`
  claims seeding happens "on every gated create/duplicate/move"; Notion assigns the new page's id
  server-side, so a create or duplicate payload has no id to seed. Only move-in seeds. The claim was
  wrong about what is possible, not about the code.

## Still open

`/code-review` (twice — Erez must launch it), then `/vet-code` steps 4–8: live verification, the
Step 1b vetting record, the card, the mint, the install, and the post-install check.

Two named gaps that must not be lost, both carried into the piece-2/piece-3 tickets when they are
filed:

- **Whether PreToolUse hooks fire for sub-agent-originated tool calls is still unverified.** If they
  do not, a sub-agent could file an unreviewed ticket straight past this gate. It needs a live
  experiment, so it belongs to `/vet-code`'s verification step, before install — not to the code.
- **`ticket-gate-events.jsonl` has no reader yet.** The `block` events are self-surfacing (each one
  exits 2 and prints why, in the same turn), so nothing there can hide. But `approve` and
  `claim-lost` are aggregate-only and accumulate unread until piece 3 adds the `/wrap` line. That
  line must show blocks-by-reason since the previous wrap, plus a flag if any `claim-lost` occurred
  at all. Re-evaluate bar: **if `claim-lost` is still zero after 50 gated writes, drop the 3-attempt
  retry loop** rather than maintain it. The rationale is in the comment above `logTicketGateEvent`.
